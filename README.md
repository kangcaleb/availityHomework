# Availity Fullstack Homework


1.	Tell me about your proudest professional achievement.  It can also be a personal or school project.  

> My proudest professional achievement would definitely be a SwiftUI component that I developed while I was at IQVIA working as a Software Engineer Intern. I volunteered to take on this work ticket after my PM had issued it as a challenge since none of our UI was built with the SwiftUI framework. After a lot of hard work, I successfully built this UI component along with the other work components. I am proud of this because I had no starter code or anything else to start off with. I was able to build this from the ground up. In addition, I did this without any prior experience with SwiftUI. Finally, the component passed QA and eventually got added to our reusable component code base that is used and reused in many of the different apps that we make. 

2. Tell me about something you have read recently that you would recommend and why. (Can be a Github Repo, Article, Blog, Book, etc) 
> A book that I am reading right now, actually, is titled, “When Breath Becomes Air”. This is an autobiography of an extremely successful doctor that contracts cancer. I would recommend it because I think it does a good job of getting us to think about the more important things in life. The author has everything going well in his life: he is getting the most prestigious job offers and is happily married. He writes about how his entire world falls apart when he starts to notice the signs of cancer. He realizes that despite his success in life, at the end of the day he is just another human being: frail and vulnerable to death, and he is left to consider what the big, important things in life are. Career is an extremely important part of our lives and we should be diligent and work hard at it, but if we totally neglect these bigger issues of life, then we would be missing out. I think for all of us driven and hardworking people, it’s important to zoom out once in a while to think about these issues, never compromising on diligent and hard work of course. This book helps me do that, so that it why I recommend the book.

3.	How would you explain to your grandmother what Availity does?
> Availity is a company that makes computer software for the health care industry. It produces helpful computer programs so that Health plans, health care providers, and other 3rd party vendors can easily communicate, manage information, and work together. Availity seeks to use technology to make it easier for these parties to work together, for the greater good and health of us all.

4. You are tasked to write a checker that validates the parentheses of a LISP code.  Write a program (in Java or JavaScript) which takes in a string as an input and returns true if all the parentheses in the string are properly closed and nested
> See ./parenthesesChecker.js

5. Coding exercise from a frontend perspective: Healthcare providers request to be part of the Availity system.  Using React framework, create a registration user interface so healthcare providers can electronically join Availity.  The following data points should be collected:
•	First and Last Name
•	NPI number
•	Business Address
•	Telephone Number
•	Email address
> See the react project located in ./registration. The application is purely frontend, it collects the required information and prints it to the console

6. For the files in CSV format, write a program in a language that seems appropriate to you that will read the content of the file and separate enrollees by insurance company in its own file. Additionally, sort the contents of each file by last and first name (ascending).  Lastly, if there are duplicate User Ids for the same Insurance Company, then only the record with the highest version should be included. The following data points are included in the file:
•	User Id (string)
•	First and Last Name (string)
•	Version (integer)
•	Insurance Company (string)
> See ./csvSorter.py
