# Availity Fullstack Homework


1.	Tell me about your proudest professional achievement.  It can also be a personal or school project.  

My proudest professional achievement would definitely be a SwiftUI component that I developed while I was at IQVIA working as a Software Engineer Intern. I volunteered to take on this work ticket after my PM had issued it challenge a challenge since none of our UI was built with the SwiftUI framework. After a lot of hard work, I successfully built this UI component along with the other work components. I am proud of this because I had no starter code or anything else to start off with. I was able to build this from the ground up. In addition, I did this without any prior experience with SwiftUI. Finally, the component passed QA and eventually got added to our reusable component code base that is used and reused in many of the different apps that we make.
